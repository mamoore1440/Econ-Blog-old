So the story would be the history of all this. This would become the set and setting of our current event. 
Unfortunately, this looks like a lot of work.


Each page/year shold have a *STORY ARC*
It would be ARCs stacked on top of each other that show the current strengths, weaknesses, and problems of the economy
 * WW2 until 70s have good economy (low problems)
 * 80s on have unproductive debt
 * 04 on has bad housing bubble
   * deflated a bit in 08, but worse now.
 * Revival attemps also



Maybe two overall sections: 
STORY                         "Characters"


There is literally no way I finish this before the crash. But that god I finally found something that gave me dopamine even after I learned everything in the system. My ADHD has prevented me from having joy from essentially anything, but now I finally have that joy and I have SOOO much of it from this. For sure I have a love hate relationship with ADHD.
