Talk about:  
* Bretton woods


Each page/year shold have a *STORY ARC*
It would be ARCs stacked on top of each other that show the current strengths, weaknesses, and problems
 * WW2 on have good 
 * 80s on have unproductive debt



Maybe two overall sections: 
STORY                         "Characters"


There is literally no way I finish this before the crash
