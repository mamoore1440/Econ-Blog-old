### Spread and Severity of Monkeypox:

Monkeypox has been around for a bit and usually

- The city has recorded 261 cases so far, out of about 4,600 across the US, according to the San Francisco department of public health.
- "San Francisco is an epicenter for the country. Thirty per cent of all cases in California are in San Francisco,” said the San Francisco health officer Susan Philip."
- More than a quarter of cases in the US – 1,341 – are in New York
- So far, San Francisco has received 8,200 doses of Jynneos, the best vaccine against monkeypox. But officials had initially requested 35,000 doses to cover the most vulnerable residents.

- In its latest report on Saturday, the Spanish Health Ministry said 4,298 cases had been confirmed in the country. Of the 3,750 patients on which it had information, 120 or 3.2% had been hospitalised, and two had died, it said without providing further details.

- Monkeypox is much harder to contract via casual conversation or in a classroom setting than COVID-19, and health experts say the risk of exposure to monkeypox is currently low. So far, the virus has mainly spread between men who have sex with men, though anyone can get the virus though close contact. While it is not a sexually transmitted infection, it most easily spreads through skin-to-skin contact and is often passed along during sexual activity.
- The virus is not deadly and hospitalization is rare, but Fischer said it is an “unpleasant” and “painful” virus. State and national health experts believe the number of cases will continue to rise exponentially and will spread. The virus causes painful, pus-filled blisters and lesions on the skin, along with fever and swollen lymph nodes in the early stages of infection. It can last from a few days to a month.

- "A team of Indian scientists have found that the monkeypox virus strain circulating in the country is different from the strain that caused 'superspreader events' in Europe, leading to a global outbreak of the disease.

The team from Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV), Pune, conducted genetic sequencing of two monkeypox cases from Kerala.

The data showed that the virus strain present in the country is A.2, that was recently imported to India from the Middle East. It was earlier present in Thailand and the US during the 2021 outbreak. However, the strain that caused superspreader events in Europe, was due to B.1."
- "We might be looking at a distinct cluster of human-human transmission and possibly unrecognised for years. The earliest sample in the cluster from the US is indeed from 2021 suggesting the virus has been in circulation for quite some time, and earlier than the European events," he added.
