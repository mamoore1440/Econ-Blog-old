### EVENTS TODAY
 - FOMC MEETING
   - .75 Raise

This is a brief update for today; this is not my daily blog post. I just wanted to update the UVXY trade because it is sad. Side note I should add emojis. I don't know how but I will figure it out. 

### TODAY'S TRADES

#### Traded Events:
*I look like a fool*:

Quick update because UVXY is down 4.5% at 10:24. I look like such a fool :tears down face emoji:. But if I'm being honest I'm deadass just gonna double down. This is still cheap af and with Vix especially it's better to be  aholder than a trader. I might buy some like 8/20 OTM calls. I think its such a good trade because VIX is by nature cyclical. All I have to do it get on the roller coaster at the bottom and sell at the top. It may not be that simple but I believe :hopium:. 

Okay it's 1:08 now. Vix is down even more. UVXY is down 6.7%. You have to be buying here. Especially after 45 days down in a row. This is sooo cheap omg. Either we are entering a new paradigm or this is the bottom for vix.
