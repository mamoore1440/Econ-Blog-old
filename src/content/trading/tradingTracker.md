<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not writing a big thing here. That being said, I would like to track my trades and have it be public so I am going to start here and now. And we are going to start with UVXY. Vix is disgustingly cheap right now. (pic here: vix 1yr chart). I expect Vix could maybe drop for another week (likely) or two (extremely unlikely), but after that it is rising and fast. I did not buy any UVXY today however I have options bought last week that I will track here.</p>

I'm not saying these trades will make me a million, but I am saying I hope these trades rack in teh $$$.
