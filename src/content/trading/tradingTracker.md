I'm not writing a big thing here. That being said, I would like to track my trades and have it be public so I am going to start here and now. And we are going to start with UVXY. Vix is disgustingly cheap right now. (pic here: vix 1yr chart). I expect Vix could maybe drop for another week (likely) or two (extremely unlikely), but after that it is rising and fast. I did not buy any UVXY today however I have options bought last week that I will track here.

Vix is still cheap on 07/27/22. Bought a lot of calls today.
